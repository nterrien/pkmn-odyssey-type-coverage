# pkmn-odyssey-type-coverage

A tool to know which Pokémon are weak or resistant to the selected type combo in [Pokémon Odyssey](https://www.pokecommunity.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-odyssey-complete-v4-1.488536/). This tool is inspired from [Pokémondb type coverage tool](https://pokemondb.net/tools/type-coverage).

Data from https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Es1clPMUhEEqZRHW0tgAmvxqSzVXiXmD/edit

The non Etrian Pokémon sprites are sprites from the 5th generation and from [Smogon](https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/smogon-sprite-project.3647722/) for Pokémon that were not in 5th Generation. Gorochu sprite from https://x.com/Dragonsden95/status/1715418155286188158.


## Modify
If you want to edit this tool for another game, the pokémon list is stored in data.js, and contains the pokemon name, types and abilities. The type chart can be edited in type-chart.js. Ability that changes damage of a type (like Levitate or Dry Skin) can be added or changed in abilities.js.
